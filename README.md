# helloWorldExp
AngularJS + Express Framework
I separated the one-page app 'helloWorld' into its MVC components, i.e. index.html, script.js files and placed them in an express framework.  Now, instead of opening the index.html using the browser, you can now start the app using 'node app.js' and access it using the port number assigned.
